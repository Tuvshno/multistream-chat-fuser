I am a Software Engineer, Freelance Video Editor, and Producer. I have lived in the creative and engineering worlds allowing me to have an interesting perspective on the software of the creative world.
In pursuit of my creative work, I dropped out of Computer Science program Virginia Tech. Despite that, I contiuened my interest in Software Engineering and built tools for myself and my peers in the industry.
Through my experiences in the creative industry, I had to pleasure and displeasure to utilize a variety of creative software. My dream is to create  a creative suite of software that is the best in the world and "Make Creative Software Great Again." In order to do this, I need to beat Adobe in the industry or take over Adobe myself! 

This website is a personal blog and display of my current work towards my dream. I hope that it provides entertainment as you read my chase to my absurdly difficult dream, but also some value as I teach back my learnings in my work.
